## How to create a Theme :art:
> `Must have(s) of a theme`
>
> Themes and plugins are found in the `wp-content` folder of WordPress.
- Create a folder e.g. `portfolio-theme` in the `themes` folder
- Open that folder in your text editor.
- Create an `index.php` file
- Create a `style.css` file 
>  `style.css` file `only` contains the  descriptions of the theme - it `can't` contain the usual `css`.
> 
> Description is put in comments e.g.
>
> :fire: style.css - This file `must` be `style.css` not any other name.
